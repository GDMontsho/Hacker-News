# Hacker News Search App

Create a React app with an input field and a button.  When the user enters a search term in the input field and clicks the button, the app should fetch articles matching the search term from the [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and display a list of links with the titles. Create a UserInput component for the input field and the button and a RenderData component for displaying the search results. Use the useEffect() hook for fetching.
